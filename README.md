## Backstory
This app is built upon the need for a database for my family's own workshop, so it was designed to fit the purposes of those needs, at first as a Highschool kid (back in 2018-2019) all I was able to do is a Microsoft Office Access database, and it worked mostly fine for a few years, but the need for a database that can be accessed from different locations by different people started to appear, all of that and the sudden DB file corruption (can't say I didn't expect that the day I designed it on MS Access) made me realise that I need to finally do an upgrade and move it be an Online web app, so Jun. 2022 started working on that with zero background on how to do it, fast forward Dec. 2022 my very first web app, is up and running, and all the old data that survived the corruption have been ported over via a custom app that was specifically created to do this job. I't s double win for me, I learned how to make a Web App Service, and i have a better DB for the workshop.
